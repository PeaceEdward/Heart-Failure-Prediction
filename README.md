# Heart-Failure-Prediction

## **Executive Summary**

This project aims to develop a predictive system for heart failure in patients using real-world healthcare data and machine learning techniques. The primary objectives are to identify key risk factors contributing to heart failure and build accurate predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.

The project leverages Python as the primary programming language and incorporates various data science and machine learning libraries. The data pipeline is designed to extract, clean, and transform patient data from electronic health records. This includes data wrangling techniques, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering to create a robust dataset for model training.

Machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, are developed and evaluated. The model development process involves data splitting, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using metrics like AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve).

The key objectives and achievements of this project include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Developed robust data preprocessing pipelines to clean and transform raw patient data from EHRs, ensuring data quality and consistency.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Employed advanced feature engineering techniques to derive meaningful features from the preprocessed data, capturing relevant information for accurate heart failure prediction.

3. **Model Development**: Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees to identify the most effective approach for heart failure prediction.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilized techniques like grid search to optimize model hyperparameters, enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities.

5. **Performance Evaluation**: Conducted comprehensive performance evaluations using metrics like precision and recall ensuring the developed models meet the desired accuracy and reliability standards.

6. **Risk Factor Identification**: Identified key risk factors contributing to heart failure, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies.

The developed system has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in early detection, risk stratification, and personalized treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of heart failure.
